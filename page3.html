     <h2> About</h2>
 <p> Mathematics competion at the browers INC. And Student in class. Our department undertakes several outreach activities in cooperation with the Canadian Mathematical Society. This is a unique program in Canada that provides students in grades 9 to 12, their teachers and parents with a deeper understanding of how mathematics can explain our world and experience how mathematics can be applied to everyday life.<strong>A program that brings together <em>mathematicians</em> and high school students from across the GTA with a keen interest in mathematics.</strong> For most of the second half of the 19th century, the University of Toronto was the only English-language university in Canada to offer programs with specializations, one being in mathematics and natural philosophy. The university launched its mathematics program in 1877, which became a model for the rest of Canada during the first half of the 20th century The Mathematical and Physical Society was founded in 1882 as a mathematics student society.

University College, home of the Mathematics Department from 1859 to 1958
In the early 20th century, the department became the first in North American to explore the field of actuarial science. At the same time, the University of Toronto's mathematics department increasingly took the lead on mathematical research in Canada. Faculty member John Charles Fields, appointed professor in 1902, was perhaps the most important in developing research at Toronto.[6] Fields organized the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians held in Toronto, and would later found the Fields Medal.</p>
