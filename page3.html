   <p> University College, home of the Mathematics Department from 1859 to 1958
In the early 20th century, the department became the first in North American to explore the field of actuarial science. </p>

  <p> At the same time, the University of Toronto's mathematics department increasingly took the lead on mathematical research in Canada. Faculty member John Charles Fields, appointed professor in 1902, was perhaps the most important in developing research at Toronto.[6] Fields organized the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians held in Toronto, and would later found the Fields Medal.</p>
